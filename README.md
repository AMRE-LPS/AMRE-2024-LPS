To assist with the process of automated system modeling, this work develops a series of microbenchmark that detects the following hardware parameters:

1. Number of Virtual Cores
2. Cache Line Size
3. Cache L3 Size
4. Cache Associativity

The details of these programs can be found in their respective folders.
